# RouteDocuments

The `RouteDocuments` node makes it possible to split documents by `content_type` or a metadata field. It takes a list of documents as input and seggregates them by either `content_type` or a meta value. 

This node is handy if you have different types of data, for example tables and text. You can then use it to route each document type to a Reader trained on it.

# JoinAnswers

The `JoinAnswers` node takes answers from two individual Reader nodes as input and joins them to product a single list of answers. 

A typical use case for `JoinAnswers` is as follows:
- Your documents contain different types of data, for example tables and text
- You use the `RouteDocuments` node to split your documents by content type
- You use a different reader for each document type and you get predicted answers form each reader separately
- You use the `JoinAnswers` node to join the answers in a single list 

Here's what an example pipeline with the `JoinAnswers` node could look like:
